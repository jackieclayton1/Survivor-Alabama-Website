        <h2>About the Event</h2>
        <p>Survivor Alabama is a modified version of CBS 'Survivor' where students compete to win the title of Sole Survivor. 
        All season footage will either be provided by our production crew or castaways themselves.
        
        <p>This will be hosted over the Fall 2025 semester, beginning in August and concluding in November. 
        We're looking for University of Alabama students from all walks of life to play in the inaugural season.</p>

        <h3>Down Time</h3>
        <p>The time in between a challenge and tribal 
            council is where the magic happens. 
            Castaways have time to socialize and 
            more importantly, strategize in preparation
            for the upcoming tribal council.</p>

        <h3>Tribal Council</h3>
        <p>Tribal council is where the merged tribe
        cast their votes to eliminate someone from the 
        game and send them to the jury.
